#Make Python program and add following procedures to it:

# 1.Assign value 47 to variable Num1
Num1 = 47

# 2. Assign value 102 to a variable Num2
Num2 = 102

# 3. Sum variables Num1 and Num2, and put the result into Sum variable
sum = Num1 + Num2
print(f"{Num1} + {Num2} = {sum}")

# 4. Subtract Num1 from Num2, then store the result in the Diff variable.
diff = Num2 - Num1
print(f"{Num2} - {Num1} = {diff}")

# 5. Multiply Sum and Diff, then place the resulting product in Product.
product = sum * diff
print(f"{sum} * {diff} = {product}")

# 6. Print the sum operation “{Num1} + {Num2} = {Sum}”

# 7. Print the sub operation “{Num2} - {Num1} = {Diff}”

# 8. Print the multiply operation “{Sum} * {Diff} = {Product}”

# 9. Print the sum, sub and multiply operations together. See “program run” below.
print(f"( {Num1} + {Num2} ) * ( {Num2} - {Num1} ) = {product}")
